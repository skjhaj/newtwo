                <div class="content">
                    <p> My research interests fall under the broad theme of <b> Distributed Algorithm,</b> spanning the research areas of <b> Distributed System and Cloud Computing,
                    Consensus Theory, Multiagent Network</b> and <b> Fairness in Algorithmic Decision Making</b>. The problems I study usually have
                    two distinct aspects: an algorithmic aspect and a societal aspect. A common thread in my research lies in collecting and analyzing large scale
                    data from online systems to understand whether there is any cause for concern, and then develop mechanisms to eliminate or reduce the impact.
                    My research agenda is inherently interdisciplinary, and therefore, the tools and theories that I often use in my works come from machine learning,
                    network science, media studies, computational social choice, social welfare and behavioral economics.</p>
